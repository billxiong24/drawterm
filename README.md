## drawterm
Script to draw terminal on screen
Run ```st```, make it full screen, then run ```stty size```. This is the number of rows and columns of the screen. Change variables in script accordingly.   
Haven't found a way to find this through command line.  
  
To run, make executable:  
```chmod +x drawterm.sh```  
Then  
```./drawterm.sh```  

## Dependencies
```st``` terminal emulator  
```slop```
